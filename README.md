# VielightBrowser
This is a fork from BonjourBrowser Android app to browse bonjour (zeroconf, avahi) services for http, ssh and vnc. 

On found services you can:
   * Launch a browser 
   * Start the integrated Browser
   * Launch an external SSH client ( recommended: [JuiceSSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh&hl=gsw&gl=US))
   * Launch an external VNC client (e.g. [AVNC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaurav.avnc&hl=gsw&gl=US))

There is a couple of special features for the internal Browser:
   * Keep the Screen On
   * Hide System Bars
   * Support a JS Dim API (for [AvNav](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.avnav.main&hl=gsw&gl=US))
   
Many thanks to Anreas Vogel "andreas@wellenvogel.de" for this fork
